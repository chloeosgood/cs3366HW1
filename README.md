This elevators control interface is not organized in the best way that it could be. 
* The spacing of the signs on the 3rd row is cramped so it is not as obviously clear which button belongs to which control.
* This spacing issue is caused by the fact all of the key switches, are not grouped together at the top or the bottom, but scatter across the 2. 

* Elevators are used with people calling it, by telling it wheather it wanted to go up or down, and then it follows the algorthim to go to the selected floors. 
* In some more rare instances elevators are used by first responders to force the elevators to get to the elevators to over ride the algorthim to respond to emergency calls. This requires, at least in the US to have a key switch for them to override the typical elevator behavior. 
* The common sequence of actions is to press the button outside of the elevator, to signal up or down. This is then followed by stepping into the elevator and pressing the button correlated to the floor the user wants to travel to. Then in some cases would press the open or close door to try to hurry the door to close or to keep it open for someone coming.
* This interface should make it easy for the daily uses by having the different floor options on the top of the interface, followed by the typical open and close door buttons.
* It shouldn't leave anything for the user to have to learn. The number will be on the button itself of the touch screen, making it without having to deal with spacing issues causing confusion.
* It will respond by lighting up when the button is pressed until the elevator reaches the floor selected.
* Some common mistakes that could be made is having the rows and columns not make sense with the amount of buttons required, as well as having it where things are awkwardly spaced or aligned. 
* The main improvement I strove to do was fix the spacing of the bottom line, as well as putting the label on the button itself. For this particular instance, having 2 rows of 3 makes sense especially since there is only 3 floors this particular elevator reaches.

* In theroy when fully implemented it would say what floor was selected as well as what floor the elevator is currently at, on a speaker for those who can not see.
